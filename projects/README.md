## 📂 Datasets Directory (`datasets/`)

This directory contains various datasets used for data analysis and model training.

### Structure

- **CSV Files (`.csv`)** – Structured tabular data  
- **JSON Files (`.json`)** – API and hierarchical data  
- **Excel Files (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)** – Spreadsheet format  
- **Parquet Files (`.parquet`)** – Optimized for big data processing  
- **Images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.tiff`)** – For computer vision applications  
- **Text Files (`.txt`, `.tsv`)** – NLP and text-based datasets  
- **SQL Dumps (`.sql`)** – Database exports  

### Usage

- **Loading Data in Python:**
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('datasets/example.csv')
  ```

- **JSON Handling:**
  ```python
  import json
  with open('datasets/example.json', 'r') as file:
      data = json.load(file)
  ```

- **SQL Data Loading:**
  ```python
  import sqlite3
  conn = sqlite3.connect('datasets/example.db')
  df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM table_name", conn)
  ```

### Contribution

- Add new datasets with proper naming conventions (`category_datasetname.extension`).
- Provide a short metadata description if applicable.

## 📂 Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)

This directory contains various scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and model training.

### Structure

- **Data Processing (`data_processing/`)** – Data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (`eda/`)** – Visualization and statistical analysis  
- **Machine Learning (`ml_models/`)** – Training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning  
- **Deep Learning (`dl_models/`)** – Neural network models and training scripts  
- **Model Deployment (`deployment/`)** – Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit apps, and Docker configurations  

### Usage

- **Run a script:**
  ```sh
  python scripts/data_processing/clean_data.py
  ```

- **Set up a virtual environment:**
  ```sh
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Contribution

- Follow modular coding practices and include comments/docstrings.  
- Use version control (Git) for tracking changes.
